<p>Features in the Base Game: No Man's Sky is a procedurally generated open universe game, created, produced and released by Hello Games. The game released in 2016 to much acclaim but also much disappointment and anger as there were many, many features said to be in the game that weren't present. The developers gave no response to the criticism and some fans went so far as sending death threats and boycotting the game completely. Here are some of the features missing from the game on launch day: <br>Landing on asteroids. Destroying space stations and fleets. Giant fleets of ships. Large freighters actually moving. <br>Faction affiliations with significance. Trade ships docking with freighters. Large scale, join-able space battles between factions. NPC ships launching from the ground. In-Atmosphere Freighters with battling. Actual ship classes and differentiation. Naming ships. More natural flight characteristics. <br>Resources depending on distance from sun, Environmental factors. </p>

<p>The Warlock is a Guardian class in Destiny that specializes in combining "magic" powers granted by The Traveler with modern weapons. Warlocks have long studied The Traveler, which gives rise to their ability to harness some of its powers. As the Warlocks advance through levels, their arcane powers grow stronger. In appearance, Warlocks can be distinguished by their rounded helmets and long vestments. As with the other player classes, in addition to head, chest armor, gauntlets, and leg armor, they have a special fifth armor slot that is unique to their class and further helps to distinguish them from their brethren in arms: a bond (armband) worn on the upper-left arm.</p>
