<p>Features in the Base Game: No Man's Sky is a procedurally generated open universe game, created, produced and released by Hello Games. The game released in 2016 to much acclaim but also much disappointment and anger as there were many, many features said to be in the game that weren't present. The developers gave no response to the criticism and some fans went so far as sending death threats and boycotting the game completely. Here are some of the features missing from the game on launch day: <br>Landing on asteroids. Destroying space stations and fleets. Giant fleets of ships. Large freighters actually moving. <br>Faction affiliations with significance. Trade ships docking with freighters. Large scale, join-able space battles between factions. NPC ships launching from the ground. In-Atmosphere Freighters with battling. Actual ship classes and differentiation. Naming ships. More natural flight characteristics. <br>Resources depending on distance from sun, Environmental factors. </p>

<p>Features in the Foundation Update: New Features added as DLC content in the Foundation update include but are not limited to: <br>Three New game modes. You can now play with three different rule sets, across three game modes. Normal mode is the original, chilled experience signature to the original version of the game. Creative mode allows explorers to build, create and explore as much as they like with no limits on anything other than their imagination. Survival mode however adds a more challenging experience with new threats and a true fight for survival. <br>There are now new death quotes for when you succumb to the elements or are killed by hazards within the game. One of the biggest features added with the Foundation Update is the ability to claim a Home Planet and build your own bespoke base at an outpost. <br>You can recruit alien lifeforms to work for you and help research new technology, you can also teleport back to your base and home planet from any space station. You can now also leave messages for people at communication terminals There are many more features added, including gardening, buying freighters and more.</p>

<p>Features I'd expect to come next:
Here are some features I'd expect to be added into the game with later updates, some of these things have also been found in the games code so could show the potential building blocks of what's coming next. A lot of the upcoming features I'm predicting are what features they missed out adding into the launch version of the game but that they are now able to add over more time.
Vehicles (land and air)
Factions and meaningful interaction between them
Portals
Missions
Different ship characteristics</p>
